# powershell-profile
my powershell profile

Install a nerd font and set it as the font for your terminal. I'm using [windows terminal](https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal) and the [Caskaydia Cove Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/CascadiaCode).
If you don't use a nerd font, many of the terminal icons won't work.

In powershell:
```powershell
notepad $PROFILE # use vim or code instead of notepad if you prefer
```

Run
```powershell
&$PROFILE # this will start up the profile 
```
